    question: 'Can I trust this seller on OLX/Amazon/Flipkart?',
    answer: "Be careful with sellers who: ask to talk on WhatsApp, share QR codes for payment, demand advance payment, have no returns policy, or have very few reviews. Always use platform's official payment system. Never pay outside the app.",

    question: 'Should I invest here? They promise high returns.',
    answer: 'Stop! No legitimate investment guarantees high returns. Check: 1) Is the company SEBI registered? 2) Are they promising "guaranteed" returns? 3) Are they pressuring you to act fast? 4) Do they have a physical office? If answer to any is yes, it is likely a scam. Report immediately.',

    question: 'Is this QR code safe to scan?',
    answer: 'Be very careful! Only scan QR codes from trusted sources. Scammers put fake QR codes on parking meters, restaurants, and online marketplace. Remember: You scan QR codes to PAY, not to RECEIVE money. If someone asks you to scan QR to "get payment", it is a scam.',

    question: 'What is digital arrest scam?',

    question: 'What is SIM swap fraud and how to prevent it?',
    answer: 'SIM swap happens when fraudsters get a duplicate SIM issued in your name. They call your telecom provider, pretend to be you, and ask for SIM replacement.

Prevention: set a SIM lock PIN with your telecom provider, never share OTP for SIM replacement, if your SIM stops working suddenly — contact telecom immediately.',
